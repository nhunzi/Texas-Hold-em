# Texas-Hold-em 

This program recreates the popular poker variant "Texas Hold'em"

What has been accomplished so far: 
    1. A user is prompted to input X amount of players.
    2. X amount of players and 5 community cards are generated. 
    3. Following the rules of Texas Hold'em, each hand can combine its cards with the community cards to create the best 5 card hand. 
    4. The best 5 card hand is determined by the program and displays the winning player. 

Bugs: I am working on writing the code for two different scenarios.
    1. Two or more players have no "special hand", and the high card deterrmines the winner.
    2. Two or more players have a flush and need to determine whos flush is better. 
      
Next steps: 
    1. I would like to make this a user-driven game with betting rounds and keeping track of chip totals for each player. 
    2. Create a GUI for the game. 
    3. Create an automated bot that the user can play against. 
    4. Use machine learning to train the bot to perform better and have the user able to adjust its difficulty setting.
